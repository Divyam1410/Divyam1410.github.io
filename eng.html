     <h2> <div id="ge" >  Art of Tamil Nadu 
<br>
        
Thanjavur painting is a classical South Indian painting style, which was inaugurated from the town of Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. Thanjavur paintings are panel paintings done on wooden planks, and hence are referred to as Palagai Padam in local parlance. In modern times , these paintings have become souvenirs for festive occasions in South India-  colorful pieces of art to decorate wall, and collectors' items for art lovers, as also sadly sometimes, dime-a-dozen bric-a-bracs to be purchased from street corner practitioners.
